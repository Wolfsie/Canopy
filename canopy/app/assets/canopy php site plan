canopy php site plan

responsive ideas
	- laptop and desktop are full page tree with animations
	- Tablet is a tree without animations
	- mobile is picture frames with some animals in the BG
		- Best way to do this? Load different view if mobile vs Desktop?
		- Are views within views possible? (look into this)
		- Ask Dan and Chris? Try to establish connection with Mo and J?


index (main page) - view of tree with views for the picture frames 
inner pages - views of page with view of inner content inside it?

Widgets: Are widgets in WP just views in PHP? (I think so...) So then couldn't a "widget" view be made for things like the picture frames and possibly the animals?
